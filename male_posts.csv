"""Is A Little Less American Evil Really Too Much To Ask For?""

Damn Good Question if you ask me.

""

Is it too much to ask for the US not to drone-bomb innocent civilians or torture suspected enemy combatants in Guantanamo?

I am frequently criticized of being too idealistic and too judgmental when it comes to politicians, whether Democrat or Republican. They're just human beings, people tell me. They're doing their best. Why am I so hard on them?

But the criticisms that I wage hardly seem like too much to ask. For example, don't destroy the entire countries like Libya and Syria. Don't kill hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq. Don't torture them at Guantanamo. Don't give massive tax cuts to the wealthy. Don't hang out with rich people who want to comprise you. And don't accept their contributions.

This is too much to ask?

Hi Jerald –

Big news for drug policy reform: After California legalized recreational marijuana use, San Francisco followed suit by clearing thousands of marijuana convictions dating back 40 years. This is a step in the right direction – now people won't be held for crimes that are no longer crimes. 

The outdated policies of the War on Drugs have done little but waste federal resources and harm lives forever. But while some of us are fighting back, others – like Attorney General Jeff Sessions – are doggedly pursuing the same failed policies. His vendetta against marijuana and people who use it goes against public opinion and completely disregards the human consequences of these unjust laws. 

But we can stop him. There's a new bill in Congress to legalize marijuana under federal law – and remedy some of the injustices of the War on Drugs. We need your help to make sure it becomes law.

Tell your members of Congress to support the Marijuana Justice Act and reform our broken criminal justice system.

How do we know that reform is needed? The data says it all. In 2013 we found that Black people are almost four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession even though Black and white people use marijuana at comparable rates.

What's more, 64 percent of Americans approve of legalizing marijuana. But Jeff Sessions' policies go against the will of the people.

Let's tell Congress to pass the Marijuana Justice Act NOW to promote equitable and proportional justice. Antiquated and out-of-touch drug laws – like Sessions' marijuana policies – have got to go.

With your help, we can make sure Congress listens to us and does the right thing.

Thanks for standing up with us,

Jesselyn McCurdy

"How the diet changed the Neanderthals.
Neanderthals dominated the territory of modern Europe for over 200,000 years. They were perfectly adapted to the conditions of the ice age, but disappeared somewhere 20,000-30000 years ago. They were replaced by Cro-Magnens, who became the progenitors of modern people.
However, it is proved that the genes of Neanderthals are in the genome of modern man.
The main part of the Neanderthal diet was meat. These are proteins and fats.
Only in the liver is glycogen in a relatively large amount.
Proceeding from this, gluconeogenesis was very characteristic for the metabolism of Neanderthals. Vegetable food accounted for a very small percentage of their diet.
The diet of Neanderthals was very similar to the diet of modern brown bears: meat, fish, snails, berries, roots and leaves of plants.
With the melting of glaciers, vast spaces of free land opened up, which were filled with plants, including berries: raspberries, blueberries, acorns. They can be dried and mixed with meat. The Indians still know the recipe for phemikana.
However, an increase in the percentage of carbohydrates in the diet led Neanderthal women to polycystic ovary syndrome and a decrease in fertility.
It has already been proved that the Neanderthals crossed with the Cro-Magnens.
Women with part of the genes of the Cro-Magnens were more fertile, because the Cro-Magnens lived in a warmer climate and consumed more carbohydrates. Gluconeogenesis in them was less pronounced, fertility is higher, their descendants and replaced net Neanderthals can and pure Kromiens who could not tolerate the cold. There was a highly adaptive race that occupied all the earth and displaced all other hominids.

Equifax (EFX.N) said in September that hackers stole personal data it had collected on some 143 million Americans. Richard Cordray, then the CFPB director, authorized an investigation that month, said former officials familiar with the probe.

But Cordray resigned in November and was replaced by Mulvaney, President Donald Trump's budget chief. The CFPB effort against Equifax has sputtered since then, said several government and industry sources, raising questions about how Mulvaney will police a data-warehousing industry that has enormous sway over how much consumers pay to borrow money.

The CFPB has the tools to examine a data breach like Equifax, said John Czwartacki, a spokesman: ""The bureau has the desire, expertise, and know-how in-house to vigorously pursue hypothetical matters such as these,"" he said...",David Noyes,status,David,male

"THE END OF EVERYTHING, as if you didn't have enough to worry about....OY Vey...

Einstein's famous equation, E=MC squared implies that energy and matter (mass) are interchangeable, that one can be converted to the other and that the amount of energy obtainable from the destruction of a given amount of mass equals the amount of mass times the speed of light squared. It also implies that the sum of matter plus energy never changes.

In nuclear reactions, ( both fission, where atoms are split and in fusion, where atoms are combined ) energy is produced in just this very way...by the complete annihilation of matter.

All the stars in the universe, including our own sun, of course, use fusion to produce energy. Deep in the interior of stars, atoms of hydrogen are combined or FUSED into helium. But the mass of the resulting helium is less than the mass of the hydrogen, and it is that ""missing"" mass that is turned into energy.

Stars may be thought of as islands of intensely concentrated energy in a vast interstellar void. It's a system, though, a universe, whose organization ( pockets of energy here and nothingness there ) is being constantly eroded, dismantled, degraded.

In other words, the degree of organization of the universe is constantly on the decrease, while the overall disorder, called entropy, is inexorably on the the rise.

Eventually this disorder, entropy, will reach a maximum as all the stars inevitably exhaust their supply of fuel and cease producing energy altogether. 

They will shine no more. There will be no more ""islands of energy""...no concentration of energy here and nothingness there. What scientists call the temperature gradient will cease to exist and that means no more usable energy available for ANYTHING.

Instead, there will be a uniform sameness throughout the cosmos. The temperature from one ""end"" of the universe to the other will be the same...just a few degrees above absolute zero. 

Appropriately enough, this is what scientists call the ""heat death"" of the cosmos. And it will be the end of absolutely EVERYTHING. There is, however, a great unknown in this dooms day scenario...dark energy and its role in the ultimate fate of the universe.

Will this enigmatic ""stuff"" change the outcome?

Nobody knows.

Some say, yes, the the cosmos will end with a whimper as in the heat death scenario described above...in other words, the end will come with a quiet ""whimper"". Others say, no the universe will continue expanding forever. Still others say, the universe will collapse into a singularity, the so-called ""Big Crunch"".

Regardless, whatever the fate of the universe...the ultimate catastrophe, if it happens at all won't likely occur for billions, if not trillions of years. So no need to worry.

And if it continues expanding indefinitely, well, we need not worry about that either, cuz that portends nothing catastrophic...as far as we know now.",Doug Hullander,status,Doug,male

INFRASTRUCTURE SCAM.
During tomorrow's State of the Union address, President Trump is expected to tout his infrastructure plan, which he has talked about since his time on the campaign trail. But a leaked draft of the plan show it's nothing more than a scam. It calls for cutting or significantly changing at least 10 bedrock environmental laws to make it easier for corporations to bypass critical protections for air, water, and wildlife. Instead of putting Americans to work rebuilding crumbling infrastructure, the Trump infrastructure scam is the administration's latest giveaway to the oil and gas industry. The only clear winners from this plan are corporate developers, while communities, workers, and the environment face untold threats. And there's no clear economic benefit from this plan, as it will decimate the Highway Trust Fund, cutting jobs and crucial infrastructure projects.
As far as environmental risks, this scam is one of the worst. It would prioritize polluter profits and cut communities out of the decision-making process for major developments in their neighborhoods. Corporations would be able to sidestep public health, worker safety, and environmental protections for infrastructure projects, including for toll roads, pipelines, drilling projects, and new mines. It allows polluters to skirt landmark public health protections like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, all while depriving funding for improvements for clean drinking water systems. It even grants authority to Interior Secretary (and friend of the oil and gas industry) Ryan Zinke to unilaterally approve new gas pipelines through National Parks. The Trump administration will attempt to brand these environmental attacks as an effort to improve the infrastructure permitting process. In actuality, they are attempting to steamroll hardworking Americans by silencing their voices in determining where pipelines, highways, and other large projects should be built, all to boost industry profits.
But Americans won't be duped by anything that puts us, our families, and our outdoor places at risk. A recent poll found that 94% of voters reject the idea that we have to put our health and outdoors at risk to improve our nation's infrastructure. So when Trump tries to use the State of the Union speech tomorrow to sell us on an infrastructure plan, we'll see it for what it is: a scam.

ACTION OF THE DAY
#HandsOff Our Medicaid. Earlier this month, the Trump administration ended Medicaid as we know it, allowing states to enact punitive work requirements as part of their Medicaid programs. The majority of working-age Medicaid recipients are already working—and majority of those who are not are either ill or disabled, caring for a loved one, or going to school. This decision has put 6.3 million Americans' health insurance at risk, and it kicks struggling workers while they're down. And according to a new report, the state of Kentucky will go a step further—requiring people who have lost their Medicaid to pass a health or financial literacy test to get health care back, harkening back to racist literacy tests in the Jim Crow South. It's the latest in his attacks on crucial programs that help families make ends meet—so take action today! Add your name to our petition urging the Trump administration to reverse their decision and keep their #HandsOff our Medicaid.

WHAT'S TRENDING
Attacking Reproductive Rights. Tonight, the Senate will vote on a 20-week abortion ban. The procedural vote has been scheduled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who promised a vote early this year after the House passed the bill a few months ago. What effects would such a restrictive ban have on women across the country? Twenty weeks is the time when women have an ultrasound that helps determine if the child will survive after birth. Read stories of women that reveal why the ban would be so harmful. In addition to the harmful effects, our country just acknowledged the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade one week ago. Such a ban would clearly violate Roe v. Wade, and thus, is unconstitutional. Even if this particular legislation fails, it reminds us to stay vigilant and continue to fight for women's rights to access safe, affordable abortion care.
#TimesUp at the Grammys. Last night, some of the biggest music stars in the country gathered for the 60th Grammy Awards. Just like the stars at the Golden Globes, many attendees showed up in support of #TimesUp, the initiative to end sexual misconduct in the workplace, by wearing white roses. Kesha gave a stunning, emotional performance of her anthem ""Praying,"" which reflects on her survival after her own experiences with sexual assault and abuse. But despite the spotlight given to #TimesUp and #MeToo, gender diversity remains a huge problem for the music industry. In fact, a new study from the University of Southern California ""showed that in the past six years, more than 90 percent of Grammy nominees have been men — a statistic that's come up a lot as the industry begins to grapple with sexual misconduct."" And, women only won one of the 10 awards broadcast during the show last night. It's clear that the music industry—as well as every other industry across America—needs more than just gestures or roses to bring about real change.

OFF-KILTER
Dog-Whistling Donald. In the aftermath of the blatantly racist ""shithole"" comment from President Trump, the latest episode of the Off-Kilter podcast explores Trump's more subtle racism, and whether that is actually more dangerous. Hear from former NAACP head Cornell Brooks and longtime disability rights advocate Patrick Cokley on these issues and why people are afraid to use the word ""racist."" And then don't miss a conversation with Inge Fryklund—a former Assistant State's Attorney in Cook County who serves on the board of Law Enforcement Action Partnership, an organization devoted to criminal justice reform and stopping the war on drugs—about the law enforcement case for legalization.

UNDER THE RADAR
Tracking Your Car. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has a new, powerful tool in their hands—and it's raising concerns about people's civil liberties. According to reports, ICE now has access ""to billions of license plate records and new powers of real-time location tracking."" While this is concerning for all Americans, it is especially concerning for immigrants, given ICE's focus on sweeping up anyone it comes in contact with, even long time family and community members. This new tool will make it easier for ICE to expand its enforcement overdrive apparatus; in addition, it could lead to more people avoiding registering their cars, ""a public safety hazard.""",Jerry Lehnert,status,Jerry,male

"FYI...

Why do we get goose bumps when exposed to cold temps and in situations which evoke fear, when we're skeet?

The short answer is that this reaction to threatening situations and frigid conditions is an evolutionary throw back.

We are descended from primates whose body was covered with hair and fur. 

For these early creatures, it was a survival advantage if they were able to appear larger and more formidable to enemies. How to do that? Cause each hair on the body to become erect. 

In freezing conditions, it was a survival advantage also to erect each hair on the body, because this action trapped body heat and provided additional insulation from the cold.

What erected body hair? Tiny muscles near the skin's surface. When these muscles are activated they form small ""pimples"" or goose bumps.

Of course, we're no longer covered with fur, but the muscles that erected the hair in our ancestors remain with us.",Doug Hullander,status,Doug,male

"FROM JOHN PAVLOVITZ
Dear Friend,
Thank you for your note to let me know you're worried about me, that you're concerned about my health—that you're not sure that I realize I'm coming across as really angry lately.
Your assessment is correct.
I am angry.
I'm sorry.
I can imagine I'm not all that fun to be around right now, and that from time to time my words come across as combative or abrasive. I'm probably more than a bit of a downer lately and I apologize.
You're going to have to bear with me, as I haven't been sleeping well for about a year or so. Admittedly I'm not at my best these days, so you'll need to forgive me. I'm chronically overtired. I'm exhausted from having to give all the sh*ts about people that you're supposed to be giving—along with my own.
I'm worn out from keeping up on legislation and watching hearings and staying on top of details and remembering deadlines and imploring action—while you go about your day as if such things are an annoyance, is if they are a disruption of your plan, as if the expiration date for my outrage has long come and gone.
I am absolutely burnt out from trying to make my voice loud enough to counteract not only the bad people's incredible volume—but your deafening silence. Both of these things are doing similar damage right now, sadly.
Believe me, I understand that my activism is a problem for you. Please know that your inactivism is similarly problematic for me. It's part of the reason I am as angry as I am; because I'm not only having to fight against those who seem furiously bent on hurting people—I'm having to fight against those who don't seem give enough of a damn that they are doing so, to say anything.
Look, I get it, I really do. It's difficult to see so much bad news, to fully face the relentless flood of terrible, to try and wrap your brain around seemingly boundless cruelty around you. It's tiresome to spend so much time with a closed fist. I know it's even a pain in the rear end to endure the continual rantings of people like me on your news feed and in your timeline and across the dinner table and in the break room.
I'm tired of me too.
I'm sick of the fight too.
I'm sick of the sound of my own voice.
I'd rather not be doing this either.
I'd much rather prefer to just enjoy life, to forget about it all, to only post pictures of puppies and my kids, and to simply ignore all that ""political garbage.""
But that is what privilege looks like; to even believe I have such an option, to have the great luxury of living without urgency because I can seemingly shield myself from it all.
That is what the bad people are counting on. They're counting on good people who are too tired, too apathetic, too selfish, or to oblivious to sustain their outrage. I am not going to give that gift to them.
As long as they're fully invested in putting people through hell, I'm going to be as invested in pushing back against it.
I think the people I love are worth it.
I think you and the people you love are worth it.
I think people I'll never meet are worth it.
And that's the rub here: love will often look a lot like rage, as it fiercely fights on behalf of those who are being attacked. 
So yes, angry is not all that I am, but I am rightly angry.
And it would be really helpful if we could carry the load of outrage right now. 
That would actually be a source of rest and joy and breath.
Friend, if you really want me to be less angry, you might try being a little more angry.
I am angry, friend.
I wish you were angry too.",Denny Haldeman,status,Denny,male

"Tiffany Foster-Grant I have a problem with the Ten Commandments. Here it is: Why are there ten? We don't need that many. I think the list of commandments was deliberately and artificially inflated to get it up to ten. It's clearly a padded list.

Here's how it happened: About five thousand years ago, a bunch of reli­gious and political hustlers got together to figure out how they could control people and keep them in line. They knew people were basically stupid and would believe anything they were told, so these guys announced that God— God personally—had given one of them a list of Ten Commandments that he wanted everyone to follow. They claimed the whole thing took place on a mountaintop, when no one else was around.

But let me ask you something: When these guys were sittin' around the tent makin' all this up, why did they pick ten? Why ten? Why not nine, or eleven? I'll tell you why. Because ten sounds important. Ten sounds official. They knew if they tried eleven, people wouldn't take them seriously. People would say, ""What're you kiddin' me? The Eleven Commandments? Get the fuck outta here!""

But ten! Ten sounds important. Ten is the basis for the decimal system; it's a decade. It's a psychologically satisfying number: the top ten; the ten most wanted; the ten best-dressed. So deciding on Ten Commandments was clearly a marketing decision. And it's obviously a bullshit list. In truth, it's a politic; document, artificially inflated to sell better.

I'm going to show you how you can reduce the number of commandments and come up with a list that's a bit more logical and realistic. We'll start with the first three, and I'll use the Roman Catholic version because those are the ones I was fed as a little boy.

• I AM THE LORD THY GOD, THOU SHALT NOT HAVE STRANGE
GODS BEFORE ME.

• THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN
VAIN.

• THOU SHALT KEEP HOLY THE SABBATH.

Okay, right off the bat, the first three commandments—pure bullshit ""Sabbath day,"" ""Lord's name,"" ""strange gods."" Spooky language. Spooky language designed to scare and control primitive people. In no way does superstitious mumbo jumbo like this apply to the lives of intelligent, civilized human in the twenty-first century. You throw out the first three commandments, am you're down to seven.

•HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER.

This commandment is about obedience and respect for authority; in other words it's simply a device for controlling people. The truth is, obedience and respect should not be granted automatically. They should be earned. They should be based on the parents' performance. Some parents deserve respect. Most of them don't. Period. We're down to six.

Now, in the interest of logic—something religion has a really hard time with—I'm going to skip around the list a little bit:

• THOU SHALT NOT STEAL.

• THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS.

Stealing and lying. Actually, when you think about it, these two com­mandments cover the same sort of behavior: dishonesty. Stealing and lying. So we don't need two of them. Instead, we combine these two and call it ""Thou shalt not be dishonest."" Suddenly we're down to five.

And as long as we're combining commandments I have two others that be­long together:

• THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY.

• THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE.

Once again, these two prohibit the same sort of behavior; in this case, mar­ital infidelity. The difference between them is that coveting takes place in the mind. And I don't think you should outlaw fantasizing about someone else's wife, otherwise what's a guy gonna think about when he's waxing his carrot?

But marital fidelity is a good idea, so I suggest we keep the idea and call this commandment ""Thou shalt not be unfaithful."" Suddenly we're down to four.

And when you think about it further, honesty and fidelity are actually parts of the same overall value. So, in truth, we could combine the two honesty commandments with the two fidelity commandments, and, using positive lan­guage instead of negative, call the whole thing ""Thou shalt always be honest and faithful."" And now we're down to three.

•THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S GOODS.

This one is just plain stupid. Coveting your neighbor's goods is what keeps the economy going: Your neighbor gets a vibrator that plays ""O Come All Ye Faithful,"" you want to get one, too. Coveting creates jobs. Leave it alone.

You throw out coveting and you're down to two now: the big, combined honesty/fidelity commandment, and the one we haven't mentioned yet:

•THOU SHALT NOT KILL.

Murder. The Fifth Commandment. But, if you give it a little thought, you realize that religion has never really had a problem with murder. Not really. More people have been killed in the name of God than for any other reason.

To cite a few examples, just think about Northern Ireland, the Middle East, the Crusades, the Inquisition, our own abortion-doctor killings and, yes, the World Trade Center to see how seriously religious people take Thou Shalt Not Kill. Apparently, to religious folks—especially the truly devout—murder is ne­gotiable. It just depends on who's doing the killing and who's getting killed.

And so, with all of this in mind, folks, I offer you my revised list of the Two Commandments:

First:

•THOU SHALT ALWAYS BE HONEST AND FAITHFUL, ESPECIALLY
TO THE PROVIDER OF THY NOOKIE.

And second:

•THOU SHALT TRY REAL HARD NOT TO KILL ANYONE, UNLESS,
OF COURSE, THEY PRAY TO A DIFFERENT INVISIBLE MAN
THAN THE ONE YOU PRAY TO.

Two is all you need, folks. Moses could have carried them down the hill in his pocket. And if we had a list like that, I wouldn't mind that brilliant judge in Alabama displaying it prominently in the courthouse wall. As long he in­cluded one additional commandment:

January 24, 2018

DESENSITIZED.
Yesterday, tragedy struck Marshall County High School in western Kentucky, as a 15-year-old student opened fire, killing 2 and wounding 18 others. The victims of the shooting ""ranged from 14 to 18 years old""—young people who have (or had) their whole lives in front of them. With such a brutal attack on high school students, you'd expect a nation in mourning, with media outlets covering the violence non-stop.
But you'd be wrong. The story barely broke through the 24/7 Trump news cycle, and most members of Congress didn't even comment on the tragedy. The President of the United States didn't say anything at all, even though he spent the morning tweeting. It's really no surprise that Americans have become so incredibly desensitized to such violence. In fact, the school shooting in Kentucky was the 11th school shooting of 2018—and we are only 24 days into the new year. And it's not just these mass shootings that are putting young people in the U.S. at such high risk. Teenagers in the U.S. between the ages of 15 to 19 are 82 times more likely to die from gun violence than teenagers in peer countries. And remember: on an average day, 96 Americans are killed with guns.
These statistics are shocking, but once you've heard them before, they start to become normalized. But we can take action to prevent future gun violence—we just need our elected officials to have the courage to stand up to the National Rifle Association (NRA). Check out this report to see why policies must be enacted to curb gun violence in America—then call your elected representatives and tell them it's time to #HonorWithAction!

ACTION OF THE DAY
#ProtectDreamers. On Monday, Congress ended the #TrumpShutdown without any solution for Dreamers. This is unacceptable. The next deadline is now February 8, and, in the meantime, 122 Dreamers are losing their protection every single day. We must continue to stand with Dreamers, and demand that Congress take action. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must be held accountable for his promises to bring legislation to the floor on DACA, and this legislation must provide a permanent solution for Dreamers, without compromising our values by allowing Stephen Miller and his allies to attach their anti-immigrant wishlist. Call your members of Congress today at 202-224-3121! Then, share the graphic below.

WHAT'S TRENDING
Global Gag Rule. A year ago, President Trump used an executive order to reinstate and expand the Mexico City Policy, also known as the Global Gag Rule. First instituted in 1984 by then-President Ronald Reagan and rescinded most recently by then-President Barack Obama in 2009, the global gag rule restricts all U.S. global health aid from being used to support abortion in any way. Under Trump's policy, U.S.-funded nongovernmental organizations are even restricted from using private, non-U.S. funds to offer abortion care, discuss abortion, or engage in activities to change restrictive abortion laws in the countries in which they work. The reinstatement of the Global Gag Rule will lead to an increase in unsafe abortions and pregnancy-related deaths among women in the poorest countries. Early analysis of the impacts of the policy shows reductions in critical reproductive health services that cannot easily be replaced.
Ditching Collection Agencies. Twelve Senators sent a letter to the Department of Education demanding it justifies the use of private collection agencies for federal student loans. Last year, the federal government paid these contractors almost a billion dollars to recover debt from about 7 million borrowers. But, a piece published today by the Center for American Progress points out that the government spent almost as much on debt collection as it did servicing accounts for 33 million borrowers who are currently in repayment. The column describes the pitfalls of using private collection agencies, and argues that borrowers would be better served by removing them from the student loan system.
Welcoming Communities. Immigrating to the United States can be a challenging journey, but it is made much harder for LGBTQ immigrants. A new report by the Center for American Progress explains the unique challenges that LGBTQ immigrants face, as well as how cities, service providers, and philanthropic organizations can make communities more welcoming to those individuals. Given that LGBTQ unauthorized immigrants make up 17 percent of survivors of anti-LGBTQ hate violence, it is crucial that cities provide a host of services are made available to LGBTQ immigrants to help them feel safe, protected, and assist them in thriving in their new community. As the report details, the types of services necessary include, but are not limited to, legal, health, employment, housing, language access, and education. If the U.S. is to continue to serve as a beacon of hope for LGBTQ immigrants around the world, communities must reform immigration policies and take concrete actions to improve services to ensure they are safe havens.

GOOD NEWS
Second Chances. In November, Florida voters are going to have the opportunity to restore voting rights for more than a million people with a felony record. Over 750,000 signatures were gathered, meaning that the proposed constitutional amendment can now appear on the ballot.

"STAND WITH DREAMERS. This article is from Progress Report.

Yesterday, a bipartisan group of senators agreed to end the shutdown, with the promise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he would bring legislation on DACA to the floor. It is unclear what exactly this legislation would look like, although McConnell said it would be ""neutral"" and allow for an open amendment process. This could lead to amendments being offered by some of the most staunch anti-immigrant senators, such as Senator Tom Cotton, who helped write the cruel RAISE Act. Such nativist, racist policies would not only prevent common sense, bipartisan talks on immigration reform, but they would put more than just Dreamers at risk.
This agreement between moderates to end the shutdown without a permanent fix for Dreamers has drawn ire from many, including other senators, who question why McConnell should be trusted. Senator Claire McCaskill, who voted ""yes"" on ending the shutdown, claims that she is not relying on McConnell's promise, but instead, the ""12 moderate Republican[s] who were willing to step forward in this."" But remaining wary about these reassurances is not only understandable but necessary. Trump has refused to negotiate in good faith and showed that he does not actually want to help Dreamers by walking away from multiple global, bipartisan deals that could have averted this shutdown in the first place. He is more interested in appealing to the members of his base that are rabidly anti-immigrant, and these efforts to appease those individuals are being led by none other than Stephen Miller. It's time for all members of Congress to stand up to such appalling policies and views and recommit to an America that welcomes immigrants with open arms.
We must continue to stand with Dreamers. The next deadline is now February 8th; but, in the meantime, another 2,000+ Dreamers will lose protection, in addition to the 17,000 that already have been exposed to risks of losing their jobs and deportation. If a permanent solution is not reached soon, the White House has already indicated it will start deporting Dreamers on March 5th. Read our ""Action of the Day"" to see how you can take action immediately.

"WE EXPERIENCE TIME TRAVEL ALL THE ""TIME"".

Over 100 years ago, Albert Einstein discovered that the rate at which time flows is affected by two parameters...gravity and the speed of the traveler. These two principles were foundational to both his Special and his General Theory of Relativity. Although it's counter intuitive...it's nonetheless true...the passage of time is not constant. It's variable.

How so, you ask...The faster one travels relative to a stationary observer, the more SLOWLY time passes for the traveler compared to that observer.

BUT, the weaker the gravity is for one individual compared to another, the more RAPIDLY time flows.

In other words, weaker gravity SPEEDS UP time passage and a faster velocity SLOWS DOWN time passage..

So here we have two competing affects. The higher relative speed compared to someone stationary on the ground, means time for the passenger passes more SLOWLY.

BUT the higher one is above those on the ground, the more the flow of time speeds UP.

Just how then do these two competing phenomena affect an airline passenger flying 500 MPH at an altitude of 35,000 feet.

Being 6 miles above the earth, where gravity is a tiny bit weaker than for those on the ground, means time for our passenger passes a bit faster.

But, since passengers are traveling over 500 MPH, time flows a little more slowly than for people on the ground.

So, which affect wins out?

As it turns out, the weaker gravity at the higher altitude, speeds UP the flow of time, more than the higher velocity of the aircraft slows DOWN the flow of time.

These affects have actually been calculated for a passenger who racked up 10,000,000 frequent flier miles at 500 MPH.

Our passenger aged 59 millionths of a second more than his homebody wife. He has traveled that far into the future compared to folks who kept their feet on the ground.

"Rocket launch over Japan looks just like California UFO reports

Anthony Watts / 40 mins ago January 19, 2018

Remember when the pre-dawn SpaceX launch from Vandenberg just before Christmas created a flurry of UFO reports in Southern California? Now it's Japan's turn.

On Jan. 18th, the Japanese space agency JAXA launched a small rocket from the Uchinoura Space Center. It made a big display. Japanese artist and photographer Kagaya captured dramatic images of the rocket's exhaust glowing in the starry pre-dawn sky over the Pacific:

""I watched the launch from Okinawa Island and photographed it using my Sony ?7RIII camera,"" says Kagaya, who has posted a must-see video of the event on Youtube:

Japan's new Epsilon rocket is relatively small, designed to launch scientific satellites at a fraction of the cost of its larger predecessors. On this occasion, the Epsilon propelled an Earth observing satellite to orbit, the ASNARO-2. Power by solar cells and carrying a large X-band antenna, ASNARO-2 is a synthetic aperture radar capable of imaging the surface of our planet with 1-meter resolution.

Shortly after the launch, noctilucent (night shining) clouds were seen over a broad swath of western Japan as ice crystals forming in the rocket's wake caught the rays of the rising sun. These clouds occur naturally around Earth's poles, but they are very rare at lower latitudes such as Japan's. In polar regions, noctilucent clouds are seeded by specks of meteor smoke, which become frosted by naturally occurring water vapor drifting up toward the edge of space.

There is no comparable episode in history… To climb the fiery ladder that the spore bearers have used one must consume the resources of a world… Basically man's planetary virulence can be ascribed to just one thing: a rapid ascent, particularly in the last three centuries, of an energy ladder so great that the line on the chart representing it would be almost vertical… Western man's ethic is not directed toward the preservation of the earth that fathered him.

"Reading ???? ????? amin maalouf:

Each individual's identity is made up of a number of elements and these are clearly not restricted to the particulars set down in official records. Of course, for the great majority these factors include allegiance to a religious tradition; to a nationality — sometimes two; to a profession, an institution, or a particular social milieu. But the list is much longer than that; it is virtually unlimited.

[…]

Not all these allegiances are equally strong, at least at any given moment. But none is entirely insignificant, either. All are components of personality — we might almost call them ""genes of the soul"" so long as we remember that most of them are not innate.

While each of these elements may be found separately in many individuals, the same combination of them is never encountered in different people, and it's this that gives every individual richness and value and makes each human being unique and irreplaceable.

[…]

It can happen that some incident, a fortunate or unfortunate accident, even a chance encounter, influences our sense of identity more strongly than any ancient affiliation.
[…]

In every age there have been people who considered that an individual had one overriding affiliation so much more important in every circumstance to all others that it might legitimately be called his ""identity."" For some it was the nation, for others religion or class. But one has only to look at the various conflicts being fought out all over the world today to realize that no one allegiance has absolute superiority.",Marco Flavio,status,Marco,male

"Microsoft says security patches slowing down PCs, servers

Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday the patches released to guard against Meltdown and Spectre security threats slowed down some personal computers and servers, with systems running on older Intel Corp processors seeing a noticeable decrease in performance.

10 Jan 2018 02:15AM(Updated: 10 Jan 2018 02:55AM)

REUTERS: Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday the patches released to guard against Meltdown and Spectre security threats slowed down some personal computers and servers, with systems running on older Intel Corp processors seeing a noticeable decrease in performance.

The security updates also froze some computers running AMD chipsets, Microsoft said in a blog post, citing customer complaints.

Shares in Intel, which reiterated on Tuesday that it saw no sign of significant slowdown in computers, fell 1.4 percent, while those of AMD fell nearly 4 percent.

AMD shares have gained nearly 20 percent in the last week as investors speculated that the chipmaker could wrest market share from Intel, whose chips were most exposed to the security flaws.

""We (and others in the industry) had learned of this vulnerability under nondisclosure agreement several months ago and immediately began developing engineering mitigations and updating our cloud infrastructure,"" Microsoft executive Terry Myerson wrote in a blog post. (http://bit.ly/2mj6f3Q)

Security researchers disclosed the flaws on Jan. 3 that affected nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, AMD and ARM Holdings.

Meltdown and Spectre are two memory corruption flaws that could allow hackers to bypass operating systems and other security software to steal passwords or encryption keys on most types of computers, phones and cloud-based servers.

Intel said a typical home and business PC user should not see significant slowdowns in common tasks such as reading email, writing a document or accessing digital photos. (http://intel.ly/2FiL0Hk)

The chipmaker said last week that fixes for security issues in its microchips would not slow down computers, rebuffing concerns that the flaws would significantly reduce performance.

Rival AMD had also played down the threat, saying its products were at ""zero risk"" from the Meltdown flaw, but that one variant of the Spectre bug could be resolved by software updates from vendors such as Microsoft.

But on Tuesday AMD said it was aware of an issue with some older-generation processors following the installation of a Microsoft security update that was published over the weekend.

Microsoft said it was working with AMD to resolve the issues.

Apple Inc also released an updated version of its operating system software on Monday to fix the security flaw.

"Things you should stop believing or saying about Astrophysics:

1) The universe expands: The universe expands, it is true, but it does so at large scales such as galactic clusters, it does not expand in the Solar System and moves us away from the other planets, or that the galaxies of the Local Group move away, because if it were like that, the Milky Way would never collide with Andromeda ever.

2) We are stardust: We have ATOMS of stars, but not only of them, other atoms are obtained from other means such as the collision of neutron stars, supernovas of type 1a or 1b, cosmic ray spacing and others.

3) When a particle and antiparticle collide annihilate: For that ""annihilation"" must be of some particle with its corresponding antiparticle as an electron and a positron, it can not if it is electron and anti-proton for example. The truth is that they do not annihilate, they become more particles, you can understand this as joining 2 and -2 gives you 0 and from this 0 you can get other particles like 1 or -1, also if you have a certain energy you can create particles that have that same energy, for example if you have 4 and -4, you can get 3 and -3 on one side and 1 and -1 on the other.

4) The cosmic microwave background is the echo or the light of the Big Bang: It would really be the light emitted 400,000 years after the Big Bang, since before that important things happened like the time of the great unification, the inflationary era, the Hadron era, neutrino decoupling and much more.",Romano Ochoa,status,Romano,male

"""Dialectic of Nature""

Below are three fundamental mathematical equations that bring a solution to the interaction in nature.

Newton's law of universal gravitation states that two celestial bodies attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This force is independent of the kinetic energies of the masses (static solution). The left wing of the equation below is the interacting force (effect, action or cause) and the right wing is the result as reaction of mass M2. It is apparent that, in this interaction, a reason causes a result but is not affected from it. In a sense, the result fully depends on the reason, but the reason is independent of result it causes.

In Einstein field equations, the force relation works with a rather strange logic. Here too, the reason (the mass that creates the space-time curvature) is not affected by the result (the object following the shortest path along this curvature). There is also another unusual breaking off here: isolation of mathematics (geometry) from physics. The left side of the equation is the curved space-time geometry, while the right side is the physics thought to form this geometry. Physicist John Wheeler describes this situation as: ""Space-time tells the matter how to move, and matter tells the space-time how to curve"". The ""cause"" and the ""result"" guide each other, but any one of them cannot affect the other, because the one is abstract mathematics, and the other is tangible physics.

We can hardly talk about cause-and-result relation in quantum physics. There is even no guarantee that a cause will have an expected consequence. There is complete uncertainty prevailing there and only possibilities are in question. Some basic particles of constant magnitude are responsible from force relations, so the reason (force) is not influenced by its result, such that the interaction process in micro and macrocosm work in totally different way. Therefore, efforts have almost no chance to achieve a unified theory with traditional physics logic.

On the other hand, the cause and result (action and reaction) in the Field-Relative Model of the Universe (UF-ME) are interpreted together and inseparably (spotlight 10 in www.researchgate.net/publication/322317299). As you can see below, the right side of the equation is zero, and in the expression on the left side, the cause and result are considered together in a way that cannot be separated from each other. So, a reason causes a result and is affected by this result. In other words, a result emerges for some reason and becomes a part of the reason which is the source of its entity. Since the ""UF-ME"" is valid in every scale from atomic structure to cosmology, this form of relationship is universal. This way of operation in whole nature makes the dynamism and ceaseless change inevitable.

Such functioning in the nature is known as ""dialectic of nature"". It can also be called as ""dialectic of interaction"" or ""dialectic of action and reaction"". The dialectical method emerged in the ancient Greek philosophy as a ""reasoning method using the antagonisms"". Since 19th Century German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel interpreted the universe as a concrete idea, he added a material content to the dialectical relation. Friedrich Engels another German philosopher defined the dialectic as the scientific theory of totality in the context of the relationship of opponents in his unfinished work ""Dialectic of Nature"". 

The dialectical method was used in ancient Greece to reach the right result in idea debates. In Marxist literature this was the fundamental method to explain the historical evolution of societies. The UF-ME shows that the process of interaction in physical nature, based on action-reaction relation, is also a complete dialectical process. At each stage after the interaction process starts, the cause (force) is not the same as the one in previous stage, because it is affected from the reaction it created. The ""result"" in later stage will also change accordingly (continuous dynamism). In this process, cause and effect cannot be separated from each other and should be evaluated together (unity of opposites). In a sense, ""God does not play dice"". In my opinion the relativistic approach to the interaction in nature is the formulation of dialectic of nature and the UF-ME is the mathematical expression of this concept. 

Most readers know now, how this dialectical method (UF-ME) provides perfect solutions to gravitation and other major mysteries in cosmology and astronomy that cannot be explained by contemporary physics (www.researchgate.net/publication/321474644 and www.researchgate.net/publication/317845079). Please keep in mind that the UF-ME will present its principal revolutionary solutions at atomic and subatomic level. You had better follow me.",Ahmet Yalcin,photo,Ahmet,male

"What is universal force-motion equation (UF-ME)?
The UF-ME is an expression of all force and motion relations between all entities in nature with a single and simple mathematical formula. The equation expresses all the entity energies of the masses together with spin and linear motion energies in the cause and effect context.  The figure below shows how this equation is formed in the case of two bodies. For an n-body system the equation can be generalized in the form of matrices. The figure shows the escape and spin field velocities of each mass at the point where the other mass is as well as their own spin and linear velocities. For the UF-ME, it is a decisive factor for how each mass perceives the total velocity fields that the other produces. The relative effective field distribution factor ?R, is obtained by dot product of two relative total field velocities perceived by each mass. The UF-ME is the gradient of (?_R/r). 
Some basic properties of UF-ME:
 Owing to the dot product of perceived total field velocities of each mass, the UF-ME both preserves the excellent symmetry of Newton's universal law of gravitation and implements Einstein's relativistic concept in its true nature.
 The force equation F=-GM_1 M_2 ?(?_R?r) is reduced to Newton's universal law of gravitation if the masses have no kinetic energies (k_i  = 0 and v_i  =0), i.e., Newton's law applies only to systems that are stationary relative to each other. The Newton law will lose its validity as the interacting objects accelerate. 
 The equation uses the relative velocity of the masses to each other, the total mass of interacting objects and mass size ratio owing to the true inertial reference frame.  In this way, it becomes applicable the force relationship between any two masses each may have any size. For example, if the two interacting masses are equal then ? = 1, and if it is the sun-photon relationship or M_1?M_2 then ? = 0. 
 The relative effective field distribution factor ?_R  of UF-ME includes both the causes (field velocities) and the results (kinetic energies of masses). In other words, the UF-ME interprets the cause and effect of an interaction simultaneously in a single and simple mathematical expression. 
 In general, the relative effective field distribution factor ?_R has also polar and azimuthal components due to the relative linear and spin velocities of the masses. Therefore the solution of UF-ME gives lateral force components besides the main radial one. 
 The UF-ME shows that gravitational repulsion is also possible under certain circumstances (www.researchgate.net/publication/317845079). We only familiar with the radial gravitational component (attractive only) from the conventional physics. 
 The polar component of interacting force causes small masses to cluster at the equatorial plane of the main body (Spiral galaxies, planets positions in Solar system, Saturn's rings, most recent observation of positions of Uranus' moons on its unusual equator plane etc.)  (Conventional theories require globular clusters only due to their spherically symmetric nature.)
 Azimuthal component causes all members of a balanced cluster system to revolve in the same direction which is the spin direction of the main body in the system (spiral galaxies and motion of the planets in the Solar system). (The spherical symmetric force relation requires rotating in random directions.)
The UF-ME is a single expression which is valid in every scale in the Universe. Readers can estimate that in the cosmic scale and visible universe with naked eye M_i?1 unit mass and r?1 unit distance while k_i?1, but in atomic and subatomic scale M_i?1 unit mass and r?1 unit distance while  k_i?1. The universal gravitation constant G  in UF-ME serves in every scale because it is a parameter specifying space fabric as indicated in one of previous spotlights. (In contemporary physics  G has no role at all in atomic scale).",Ahmet Yalcin,photo,Ahmet,male

"SOMETHING WE ALL NEED TO THINK ABOUT

Paleontologists, archeologists, evolutionary biologists and biochemists concur with near unanimity. Upwards of 99% of all species that once walked the earth, that once burrowed in the soil, inhabited the bodies of others, swam in the oceans and rivers or flew in the atmosphere above...are no more. They are extinct. The scientific data ( the fossil record ) indisputably confirms it. Again 99%...gone!

In almost every instance, organisms disappeared because of their failure to adapt to a changing environment: they failed to adapt to drastic weather alterations; failed to find new habitats after theirs was destroyed; fell victim to invasive predators; or they were annihilated by asteroid impacts, etc.

Faced with an inability to cope, to change with conditions that threatened their very survival, they succumbed en mass, completely disappearing, never to return again.

And so humans must face the age old question: will our species follow suit or will we be the exception to this fatal fate of our own species ? 

Will our superior intelligence enable us to beat those odds? Will we able to adapt...to outwit what has been the inevitable death knell for most every other creature?

Or will our willful ignorance, our false sense of superiority and invulnerable result in the exact opposite...will these foibles be our undoing...will they result in the same fate that befell the doomed 99%?

Further, do we have the will to determine which direction our intellect will lead us? Will our failure to mitigate the effects of climate change with all its dire consequences spell the eventual end? Will over use of anti-biotics do us in? Will thermonuclear global warfare be the end of our reign on earth?

Our planet has already undergone 5 mass extinction events. We are overdue for the 6th. Will we be its victims?

Fifty, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand years from now, will we have become extinct like the thousands of other species. Could we have prevented, but because of sheer stupidity didn't?

Per the Washington Post, the top 100 private land owners in the U.S. own a combined 40.2 million acres, an amount of land roughly equivalent to Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine combined. That's up from only one New Hampshire and Maine's worth of America (27.2 million acres) in 2007.

And this argument completely sets aside the local economic, ecological and scientific value of these lands.  There is no valid excuse for removing protected status UNLESS you intend to capitalize the resources and damage the lands.",Bruce Jensen,status,Bruce,male

""Last-Minute Tax Break Could Enrich Trump And GOP Leaders""
–International Business Times, December 15

Now we know why Donald Trump's tax bill was written entirely behind closed doors.

To win the last few votes necessary to ram their bill through, GOP leaders reportedly inserted a last-minute loophole that will save themselves and Donald Trump's businesses millions of dollars, while the rest of the bill raises taxes on tens of millions of middle-class families.

The two most prominent beneficiaries of this crooked deal? Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker – who flipped his vote from NO to YES within hours of the final bill's release – and Donald Trump himself.

Meanwhile, 50% of Americans expect this bill to raise their own taxes to pay for Trump and Corker's sweetheart deal.",Jerry Lehnert,status,Jerry,male

"Some said that the old fiat cu?rency system by the Fed steals the wealth of the working and middle class people for the rich and super rich.  

We know now that Fed manipulates not only the markets but the monetary system in favor of the super rich thus, a new paradigm was invented by Nakamoto in 2009.  Called the digital crypto currency, it was introduced to get out of the manipulation and control of the Fed. 

Bankers says it is a hoax. But crypto currency is rising. One reason perhaps  is--no bank intermediaries thus no interests. 

In fact, not only the people are investing into cypto currencies but countries too, like Venezuela is into petro coin now. It is backed by oil. Russia, Syria and Iran too, are thinking of going into crypto currency to fight the sanctions by the US. Possibly, North Korea will jump into it, too.

Just recently, however, the bankers  set out a futures trading on crypto currency. Some experts on crypto currency said, however, it is not affected by the chronic cycle of bubble and bursting as the old fiat currency system of the Fed.

That is if one considers the current situation of the US economy--it hasn't recovered since the 2008 financial mojo. 

Of course, we all know that proclaiming Jerusalem as the capital  of Israel was used for a long time as a leverage to Israel. I'm sure Trump fully knows well the direct consequence of his move--it will unify the Arabs against Israel.  We are seeing this already.

"THIS IS SCIENCE

Differing opinions are fine and are to be expected when the topics are somewhat nebulous, uncertain or not quantifiable. 

But in regards to evolution and to certain findings in cosmology, the uncertainty has largely been removed by convincing evidence. 

That's not to say there will never be modifications, all theories in science are amenable to revisions as discoveries are made, but the basic principle of evolution, in particular, is as if carved in Stone. 

The same holds true for other scientific principles. Examples...Newton's  precepts in classical physics were modified by Einstein's theory of relativity and HIS ideas were modified by quantum mechanics. 

Such flexibility is the hallmark... the nature of science. Driven by new discoveries, it's forever self-correcting, always improving upon itself...always searching for the truth...and in doing so it hopefully improves the world and the human condition.",Doug Hullander,status,Doug,male

Jacinta has devolved a 'stacking technique' to combine data to overcome the problem of detecting weak hydrogen signals from distant galaxies. She has been using data from  the Parkes Dish and the Hershel instrument to helps us understand the role of hydrogen in the evolution of galaxies.
After recently moving from ICRAR in Western Australia to Croatia,  her research is now looking at how black holes at the centres of galaxies can effect star formation, and is now using data from the Jansky VLA to continue this collaborative research.
 
For observers and astrophotographers, Dr Ian 'Astroblog' Musgrave tell us what to look for in our morning and evening skies over the next days and weeks, and how to best observe the imminent Geminid Meteor Shower. In 'ian's tangent' he tells us about Australia's early eminence in Space with the 50th Anniversary of the launch of our first satellite, WRESAT

"Will the Agung volcano be able to cool the planet's climate again?

11/29/2017

The awakening of the Agung volcano has alerted the island of Bali, which has forced to evacuate at least 100,000 inhabitants of the area and close the airport in the city, causing in turn that 120,000 tourists are trapped.

But beyond these important disorders for the local population and its visitors, there is some expectation in the scientific community for the possibility that a large explosion may happen in the coming days and that the resulting cloud of ash and gases will later cause some effect in the climate of the Planet. And it is that this same volcano already caused in 1963 a global cooling of the Earth that was estimated of two years of duration.

Alert status in Bali
Last Saturday the authorities of this beautiful Indonesian island raised the alert level as the ash cloud became even more important, ordering the immediate evacuation of around 40,000 people in the area with the perspective that this week it would be necessary to evict a total of of 100,000 inhabitants.

But many of them are not willing to leave their belongings and their animals, perhaps because it is not the first time that the Balinese see Agung spitting ash into the atmosphere and are accustomed to its roar. The previous major eruption dates from 1963 and left 1,600 dead.

The temperature of the Planet dropped to two degrees
After that violent explosion of ash and gases to the Indonesian sky, the scientists detected in the two following years a global cooling of the temperature of the planet between 1 and 2 ?C.

Other volcanoes that caused similar eruptions later, such as Mount St. Helens in 1980 (the most disastrous eruption in the history of the United States) did not have the same impact on Earth's climate.

The explanation is fundamentally due to two factors: the presence of sulfur in large proportions and the height at which the fumes and gases are high in the eruption.

The relevant role of sulfur in modifying the climate
For an eruption of this type to be able to modify the climate of the planet it must happen that the cloud of ash and gases is able to reach the stratosphere, an area of ??the atmosphere where these compounds can block the arrival of solar energy.

And is that the high presence of sulfur dioxide makes the filtering of sunlight more effective, contributing more importantly to reduce the temperature of the planet.

Agung is located in an area of ??the Planet that, due to its latitude, has the stratosphere at an altitude higher than other regions closer to the Poles, and this is another handicap for ash and sulfur to block the sun's energy, unless the eruption is as powerful as that of 1963 and get rise above the troposphere.

The closest precedent that managed to modify Earth's climate was Mount Pinatubo (Philippines) when it erupted in 1991, sending 20 billion tons of sulfur dioxide to the sky.

"WE EXPERIENCE TIME TRAVEL ALL THE ""TIME"".

Over 100 years ago, Albert Einstein discovered that the rate at which time flows is affected by two parameters...gravity and the speed of the traveler. These two principles were foundational to both his Special and his General Theory of Relativity. Although it's counter intuitive...it's nonetheless true...the passage of time is not constant. It's variable.

How so, you ask...The faster one travels relative to a stationary observer, the more SLOWLY time passes for the traveler compared to that observer.

BUT, the weaker the gravity is for one individual compared to another, the more RAPIDLY time flows.

In other words, weaker gravity SPEEDS UP time passage and a faster velocity SLOWS DOWN time passage..

So here we have to competing affects. The higher relative speed compared to someone stationary on the ground, means time for the passenger passes more SLOWLY.

BUT the higher one is above those on the ground, the more the flow of time speeds UP.

Just how then do these two competing phenomena affect an airline passenger flying 500 MPH at an altitude of 35,000 feet.

Being 6 miles above the earth, where gravity is a tiny bit weaker than for those on the ground, means time for our passenger passes a bit faster.

But, since passengers are traveling over 500 MPH, time flows a little more slowly than for people on the ground.

So, which affect wins out?

As it turns out, the weaker gravity at the higher altitude, speeds UP the flow of time, more than the higher velocity of the aircraft slows DOWN the flow of time.

These affects have actually been calculated for a passenger who racked up 10,000,000 frequent flier miles at 500 MPH.

Our passenger aged 59 millionths of a second more than his homebody wife. He has traveled that far into the future compared to folks who kept their feet on the ground.",Doug Hullander,status,Doug,male

"Chaque Jour est une occasion de merci au Cr?ateur car notre vie est entre ses mains. Sur cette terre sois tu choisis d'?tre mauvais soit tu choisis d'?tre une bonne personne, c'est le libre arbitre.

la m?chancet? sur cette terre s'est accrue, de plus en plus de guerres, l'esclavage de retour, l'adoration du dieu argent, sorcellerie, nous montre que beaucoup ont choisis le mal et ils sont nombreux ? le faire.

le mal est devenue tellement recurent que c'est devenue la norme. or le salaire du p?ch? c'est la mort mais le don gratuit de Dieu c'est la vie ?ternel.

choisissons de faire le bien, choisissons de d?noncer le mal, de d?noncer l'esclavagisme non pas seulement en libye mais en arabie saoudite, au liban et dans tous ces pays arabes o? plusieurs sont hypocrites ils rev?ts une apparence de pi?t? pourtant ils sont plein de m?chancet? et de p?ch?.

il crie Allah 6 fois par jour aux yeux de tous mais viol, vole et tue en cachette. ""or le diable ne vient que pour voler, d?rober et ?gorger"" A bon entendeur

Employers including Amazon, EBay, NASA JPL, and Yahoo all use Spark to quickly extract meaning from massive data sets across a fault-tolerant Hadoop cluster. You'll learn those same techniques, using your own Windows system right at home. It's easier than you might think, and you'll be learning from an ex-engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb.
Spark works best when using the Scala programming language, and this course includes a crash-course in Scala to get you up to speed quickly. For those more familiar with Python however, a Python version of this class is also available: ""Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python – Hands On"".

Now on this background I have couple of questions for which I require answers  -

Q1). Does the ratio of my negative and positive cases in the training data affects learning of my Regression Model ?
Q2). Should I consider co-related attributes for training the model or only independent ones. Does it affect Performance or Cost Function ?

"Hi All,

This isn't a 'big' data question but I'm going to post up here as I think there is not a bad chance that someone here will have some good suggestions.

I have some data on a process ... this process occurs in the low five figures of per year and originates in a dozen or so different settings. There are about 8 or so variations of the process itself (some of which even merge but I want to ignore that for now). The process also has a handful of different outcomes. We know the duration of the process for all settings and outcome types although one outcome is 'un-outcomed' which has a duration from origin until 'today' (rolling).

There are some values for how long the process 'should' take but sometimes it takes longer.

 What I want is one-big-in-your-face graphic that shows all of that.

A table won't do it. A crude tree diagram won't do it.

I need a tree diagram template that allows me to do the following:

For each origin show branches from a tree with widths determined by the relative frequency of that source. For each sub-type of the process twigs coming off those branches also with their width determined by relative frequency of the whole. Twigs should vary in length with the average duration of that sub-type coming from that origin. When a twig is longer than the recommended time it should change from green to red. 

Does anyone know of (preferably free) software that can do this?

"Hi everybody, 

I started this group slightly over a year ago in late December 2012 and it has been astonishing to see how quickly the group grew. And I take this as a sign that there is a desire for a forum like this to share ideas with other data scientists and individuals interested in big data.

As the group grew in size, there were gradually more and more posts which were job offers or offers for various forms of training. I decided to allow this because at the time I felt that it these might be valuable resources for members in the community. However, this trend has spiraled out of hand and it now feels like those types of messages have drowned out the fruitful exchange of ideas that we once had in the community.

Thus, as of Saturday January 11th 2014, any posts that are advertisements will be deleted and will be grounds for banishment from the group. This includes but is not limited to posts about job offers and paid trainings. 

If you wish to share information about a free educational resource such as new course on Coursera, edX or Udacity that you plan to sign up for or have taken in the past that is perfectly ok. You can also share about books, blog posts and podcasts that you have found useful so long as it is not self-promotion. Use common sense when sharing with the community.

Wishing you all the best in your data science journey! - Henrik Nordmark",Henrik Nordmark,status,Henrik,male
