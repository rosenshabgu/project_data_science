"Cluster analysis using SAS and R
Cluster analysis is the bread and butter of marketing. It has many aspects like 
• hierarchical clustering, 
• non-hierarchical cluster (k means clustering) and many lingo associated with the same like dendogram, scree plot, Euclidean distance, simple linkage, wards method etc. 

The tutorial on clustering  is one of the easiest way to master these concepts. This explains cluster analysis using SAS along with various options of SAS, working of hierarchical and non-hierarchical algorithms, step by step explanation of SAS output, differentiation with objective segmentation techniques etc.
It also explains the 
• clustering using R
• cluster analysis guideline for data mining scenario

"Ultimate Course in Basic Statistics
Statistics has been probably one of the most difficult course to master across the globe for MBA students. It is all because it is being explained in a wrong way. Across the globe most of the faulty are not been able to simplify it for students, even if they know it in great detail. 
The right way of learning statistics is when one can see the demonstration of concepts through simulation of a concept and then go through the theoretical concept. The tutorial Statistics by example explains statistics by simulation. The tutorial covers
• Probability and expectations
• Central tendencies and dispersion
• Central limit theorem
• Sampling distribution 
• Hypothesis testing 
• Linear regression
• Categorical data analysis and chi square test of independence
• ANOVA
• Non parametric tests

Modern Data Warehouse Roundtable Webcast - 15th October

REGISTER: http://tinyurl.com/o2lvc87

If necessity is the mother of all invention, then it's no wonder the technology space moves so fast. From the consumerization of IT to the steady emergence of innovative solutions, organizations often struggle to stay afloat in the sea of options. As we march steady to the pace of Moore's Law, analysts and business users expect quicker and easier access to enterprise data, and the data warehouse of yore must modernize to meet those demands. 

Register for this Roundtable Webcast with Analyst David Loshin, Dwaine Snow of IBM and Heine Krog Iversen of TimeXtender. This expert panel will discuss the market forces that brought data warehousing to its current state and the key factors driving today's innovation. They will explore how new data types and sources are raising analytic expectations and changing the way enterprises design information architectures.",Aneta Rapacz Polaczek,photo,Aneta,female

Why learn Hadoop?
We create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day. So much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone (Source: IBM). These extremely large datasets are hard to deal with using legacy systems such as RDBMS as data exceed the storage and processing capacity of database. The legacy systems are becoming obsolete.

According to Gartner: ?Big Data is new Oil?. Big Data is all about finding the needle of value in a haystack of Structured, Semi-structured and Un-structured data. Hadoop (the Solution of All Big Data Problems) has become the most important component in the data stack, which enables rapid processing of data at petabyte scale. Hadoop is expected to be at the core of more than half of all analytics software within the next two years.",Radhika Khd,status,Radhika,female
